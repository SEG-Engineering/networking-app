# Networking App - Project Status Update

## Current Status
We are in the authentication and authorization implementation phase. We have successfully:
1. Set up the database schema with user model
2. Created basic auth utilities (JWT tokens, password hashing)
3. Started implementing auth endpoints

## Current Work
Testing and implementing authentication endpoints:
- [x] Basic JWT token creation and verification
- [x] User registration endpoint structure
- [ ] Complete registration endpoint testing
- [ ] Login endpoint implementation
- [ ] Session management
- [ ] Protected routes

## Next Steps (Prioritized)
1. Authentication & Authorization (Current Phase)
   - Complete endpoint testing
   - Implement login functionality
   - Add email verification
   - Set up password reset flow
   - Add remember me functionality
   - Implement protected routes

2. UI Implementation (Next Phase)
   - Landing page for non-authenticated users
   - Dashboard for authenticated users
   - Navigation and menu system
   - Settings page
   - User profile management

3. Feature Implementation (Future Phase)
   - Contact management
   - Email templates
   - Calendar integrations
   - Follow-up system
   - Notifications

## Technical Details
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Authentication: JWT-based with HTTP-only cookies
- API Routes: Next.js API routes with proper middleware
- Frontend: React with Next.js
- UI Components: shadcn/ui library

## Testing Notes
Current focus is on auth endpoint testing:
```bash
# Test registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Password123!",
  "name": "Test User"
}'

# Test login (coming next)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "Password123!"
}'
