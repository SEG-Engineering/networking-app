##Step 1: Stage and Commit Changes
Stage Changes:

Open the Source Control panel by clicking the Git icon on the left sidebar (or press Ctrl + Shift + G).
Click the + icon next to the files you want to stage. Alternatively, stage all changes with:
csharp

git add .
Commit Changes:

In the Source Control panel, type a commit message in the input box (e.g., "Initial commit") and click the checkmark icon.
Or commit via the terminal:
sql
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message"


##Step 2: Push Code to the Remote Repository
Push the code to the remote repository via the terminal:

css
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Replace main with your branch name if it's different (e.g., master).
Alternatively, in the Source Control panel, click the … menu (top-right) and select Push.

Additional Tips
Cloning a Repository: If you’re starting with an existing repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-URL>
Then open the cloned folder in VS Code.

Branch Management: Create and switch branches:

arduino
Copy code
git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
Pull Changes: Always pull the latest changes before pushing:

css
Copy code
git pull origin main
With this workflow, you'll be able to manage your Git repository efficiently within VS Code!
